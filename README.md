# Account Management System
A logic-based shop and inventory system developed in Python to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and data persistence.

## 🚀 Features
* **Dynamic Account Management:** Tracks player name, balance, and inventory in real-time.
* **Interactive Shop System:** Buying and selling logic with automated price calculation and inventory checks.
* **Data Persistence:** Saves and loads player data using JSON files so progress is never lost.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Storage:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
* **File Handling:** Python `os` module

## 🕹️ How to Use
1. **Run the program:** `python Acount.py`
2. **Login:** Enter your name to create a new save or load an existing one from `Acounts.json`.
3. **Actions:** Type `kaufen`, `verkaufen`, `status` or `ausgeben` to interact with the system.

## 🎯 Learning Progress
This project represents my first deep dive into classes and file handling. It taught me how to structure complex logic and manage data across different sessions. This is a core skill I want to bring into my vocational training at SAP.
